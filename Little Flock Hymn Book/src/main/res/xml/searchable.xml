<!-- The attributes below configure how the search results will work:
 - the 'label' points to a short description used when searching within the application if
   'badge mode' is used as specified with android:searchMode="useLabelAsBadge" (which it is not for
    this application).
 - the 'searchSettingsDescription' points to a string that will be displayed underneath the
   name of this application in the search settings to describe what content will be searched.
 - 'includeInGlobalSearch' will include this app's search suggestions in Quick Search Box.
 - 'searchSuggestAuthority' specifies the authority matching the authority of the
   "HymnBookProvider" specified in the manifest.  This means the HymnBookProvider will be
   queried for search suggestions.
 - 'searchSuggestIntentAction' the default intent action used in the intent that is launched based
   on a user clicking on a search suggestion.  This saves us from manually having to fill in the
   SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_ACTION column for each suggestion returned by the provider.
